# Template
Template  for class submissions

There will be 3 main folders: Homeworks, Quizzes, and Project Assignmments. There  will be subfolders. Create subfolders as in  this template
under the main folders. Create the hierarchy of folders and subfolders at Github itself.  Place your documents (zip, Word, PDF, PPT, .jpeg, .html, .css, js, etc., ) in these subfolders by 'dragging and dropping' - for this you will have to click 'upload files' first at the Github site.  I will demo this in the class of 9/21/16.  

Please limit the individual uploads to 20 Mbytes or less. The max allowed is 100 Mbytes per upload, with a total limit of 1GB. All videos and images should be uploaded to other online sites such as Flickr and Youtube. FAU has accounts. Let me know. Just provide links here to those. Keep these repos light! I hope this wonderful free resource will last a long time! Make sure the links actually work - that is, they do not point to a password protected shared resource such as Dropbox or Googledoc. 

Github was developed mainly to track code  development in a group environment. Your project folder can be cloned directly here at the same level of the main folders. This will ensure that Github versioning and other functionalities are available to your project folder. For this,
you may have to copy the contents (not the pareent folder) directly into your desktop folder. Or, better  yet, you  can  maintain a separate tab at Github for that. More on this soon!
